# ZKP Implementation Progress

Currently working on implementing a basic zero-knowledge proof system using Rust. This has been a great experience.

## Key Learnings

1. **Rust Basics**: Learned how to write efficient and safe code in Rust.
2. **ZKP Concepts**: Explored the fundamentals of zero-knowledge proofs.
3. **Integration**: Successfully integrated Rust with cryptographic libraries.

## Next Steps

- Optimize the proof generation process.
- Explore more advanced ZKP use cases.
