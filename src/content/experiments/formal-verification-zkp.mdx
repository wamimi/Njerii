# Formal Verification of Zero-Knowledge Proof Circuits

Completed a comprehensive study on applying formal verification techniques to zero-knowledge proof circuits. The research focused on automatically proving that circuits correctly implement their intended functionality.

## Key Achievements

1. **Automated Soundness Proofs**: Developed tools to automatically verify that circuits are sound
2. **Completeness Verification**: Ensured that valid witnesses always produce accepting proofs
3. **Zero-Knowledge Property**: Formally verified that proofs reveal no information about witnesses

## Tools and Techniques

- **Lean 4**: For mathematical proof verification
- **Coq**: For circuit specification and verification
- **Custom DSL**: Domain-specific language for circuit description

## Impact

This work has been integrated into the development workflow at Supra Oracles, significantly reducing the time required to audit new ZK circuits while increasing confidence in their correctness.

The formal verification framework is now being used to verify critical components of the protocol, ensuring mathematical guarantees about security properties.
