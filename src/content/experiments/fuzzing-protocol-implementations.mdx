# Fuzzing Protocol Implementations for Edge Case Discovery

Currently developing a comprehensive fuzzing framework for testing cryptographic protocol implementations. The goal is to automatically discover edge cases and potential vulnerabilities that traditional testing might miss.

## Methodology

1. **Property-Based Testing**: Define invariants that should hold for all valid inputs
2. **Mutation Fuzzing**: Generate malformed inputs to test error handling
3. **Coverage-Guided Fuzzing**: Use code coverage to guide input generation

## Initial Findings

- Discovered several integer overflow conditions in parsing logic
- Found timing side-channels in signature verification
- Identified memory leaks in error handling paths

## Next Steps

- Integrate with continuous integration pipeline
- Expand to test consensus mechanisms under adversarial conditions
- Develop domain-specific fuzzing strategies for ZK circuits
