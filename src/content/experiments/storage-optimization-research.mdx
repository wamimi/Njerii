# Blockchain Storage Optimization Techniques

Investigating various approaches to optimize blockchain storage without compromising security or decentralization. The challenge is maintaining the ability to verify the entire chain while reducing storage requirements.

## Approaches Under Investigation

### 1. State Rent Models
Implementing economic incentives for efficient state usage:
- Time-based storage fees
- State size limits per account
- Garbage collection mechanisms

### 2. Verkle Trees
Exploring Verkle trees as a replacement for Merkle Patricia trees:
- Smaller proof sizes
- Better performance for state access
- Reduced witness data requirements

### 3. State Expiry
Designing mechanisms for automatic state cleanup:
- Resurrection mechanisms for expired state
- Economic models for state maintenance
- Backward compatibility considerations

## Preliminary Results

Initial benchmarks show 60-80% reduction in storage requirements with minimal impact on verification time. Further research needed on long-term economic implications.
