# ZK Proof Demo

An interactive web application demonstrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs with practical examples and visualizations.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to make Zero-Knowledge Proofs accessible and understandable to developers new to cryptography. It provides:

- Interactive visualizations of ZK circuits
- Step-by-step walkthroughs of proof generation
- Browser-based demos of ZK applications

## Implementation Details

### Technologies Used
- Rust for backend cryptographic operations
- WebAssembly for client-side cryptography
- React for the user interface
- D3.js for interactive visualizations

### ZK Protocols Implemented
- zk-SNARKs using the Groth16 protocol
- Bulletproofs for range proofs
- zk-STARKs (simplified demo version)

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Learning**: Users can modify parameters and see how the proofs change
2. **Visual Circuit Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating simple ZK circuits
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Compare different ZK protocols on various devices

## Development Challenges

Some interesting challenges I faced during development:

- Optimizing WebAssembly binary size while maintaining performance
- Creating intuitive visualizations for complex mathematical concepts
- Balancing educational value with technical accuracy

## Future Work

I plan to expand this project with:
- More advanced ZK protocols
- Integration with real blockchain applications
- Collaborative circuit building features

## Project Status

This project is continually evolving, with new features and improvements added regularly. The current version focuses on educational aspects, while future iterations will include more practical applications.
