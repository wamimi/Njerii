        Oh, so curiosity led you here? Well, buckle up – you're about to meet someone who is unabashedly cringe and who loves fashion!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I spend most of my days as a Rust intern at Supra Oracles, diving into formal testing – fuzzing protocols and optimizing blockchain storage systems. (Trust me, it's more exciting than it sounds!)
      </p>

      <p>
        The Rust journey? It's been quite the ride. I've developed this peculiar love-hate relationship with the borrow checker (we're frenemies now, but we're working on it). And yes, I'm still learning – because with Rust, it's an endless adventure of discovery. After all, my motto is simple: the grind must be there cause it's either perfection or nothing, be the best or stop trying.
      </p>

      <p>
        But life exists beyond the terminal, you know? I'm the force behind LedgerLady, where we're rewriting the blockchain narrative. Over at ETH Dada (yes, 'Dada' means sister – how cool is that?), we're building a sisterhood of Solidity developers who believe in lifting each other up.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am also learning to have fun, because who said devs can't have fun? I am talking anime, books, being cringe, and fashion.
      </p>

        Dreams don't work unless you do. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some code to perfect and anime episodes to catch up on (watching apothecary diaries s2 rn) ✨
